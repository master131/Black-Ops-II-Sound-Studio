## Features:
* Supports both Black Ops II and Black Ops III.
* Load SABS or SABL files
* Supports XBOX, PS3 and PC (refer to the limitations/problem list)
* Files names of many audio entries are recognised
* Displays basic header information
* Shows all audio entries
* Allows you to replace existing audio with your own (with built-in conversion, many video and audio formats supported)
* Export audio entries
* Built-in audio player that can play formats natively without extra codecs

## Limitations:
* Audio replacement of XMA audio entries are currently not supported as an encoder hasn't been added yet.
* Audio replacement for PS3 is not tested.
* Replacing headerless WAV audio with your own that is 1 second or more longer than the original will result in SP missions loading forever (same might happen with MP, not tested)
* Backups are not created, it's up to the user to do that themselves.
* Editing the asset references list actually does nothing when saved to disk.
* Saving is only supported for Black Ops 2 SABS/SABL files.
